# Sky130 Coupled DAC And Comparator Bit

- status: `coupled_dac_comparator_all_code_bit_sweep_characterized_not_full_sar_proof`
- measured trials: `1` of `2`
- correct polarity: `1` of `1`

- failing codes: `[]`

## What This Closes

The DAC and comparator are in one SPICE transient. The physical capacitor array produces the top-plate voltage, the comparator's transistor input switches sample that node, and the same preamp/latch resolves the decision. This removes the biggest abstraction in the earlier replay: the comparator no longer receives a numerically injected threshold.

The working repair removes the source-follower stage that introduced a midrange sign offset and instead samples the physical DAC top plate directly after redistribution. The current long schedule uses a 32/64 um source switch, 4.0 ns acquisition, a 5.0 ns bottom-plate transition, comparator sampling at 9.1-9.6 ns, preamp enable at 9.7 ns, and latch fire at 11.7 ns. This gives the 8 pF MSB time to settle before the decision while preventing the active preamp from loading the DAC during sampling. The all-code sweep is a complete nominal code-level handoff, but it still does not sequence retained bits into a full SAR conversion.

It is still only one bit-cycle boundary. The controller does not yet sequence four physical redistributions, retain bits, or repeat the experiment over PVT and mismatch.

## Results

| code | DAC top after redistribution V | DAC-reference diff V | comparator output diff V | correct polarity |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 7 | timeout/error | timeout/error | timeout/error | False |
| 8 | 1.528801 | -0.186571 | 1.411760 | True |

## Refused Claim

does not prove a complete multi-bit SAR, DAC calibration, mismatch/noise yield, PVT closed-loop accuracy, extracted layout, board behavior, or silicon
